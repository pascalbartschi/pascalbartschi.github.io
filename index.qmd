# Hi, I am Pascal!

Welcome to my website!

I'm a research professional specializing in ecology and environmental studies. With expertise in computational biology and bioinformatics, I explore the intricate dynamics of ecosystems. From uncovering hysteresis behavior in symmetric ecosystem models to simulating mutual inhibition-driven ecosystems, I strive to understand and contribute to our understanding of the natural world. 

Join me as I showcase my research experience, including my role as a Research Assistant at the University of Zurich, where I'm working towards publishing key results. I've also completed an internship in ecology, delving into the fascinating topic of ecosystem behavior under mutual inhibition. 

In addition to my research pursuits, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Biology and Computational Science, and I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at ETH. I've been recognized for my academic achievements, including the semester prize I received for my internship thesis.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I've gained valuable experience in logistics, military service, and healthcare. With advanced programming skills in Python and R, I bring computational prowess to my research endeavors.

Explore my website to learn more about my work, skills, and achievements. Get [in touch](mailto:bartschi.compsci@gmail.com) if you'd like to collaborate or discuss exciting opportunities!
