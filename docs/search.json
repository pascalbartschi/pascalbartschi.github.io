With expertise in computational biology and bioinformatics, I explore the intricate dynamics of ecosystems. From uncovering hysteresis behavior in symmetric ecosystem models to simulating mutual inhibition-driven ecosystems, I strive to understand and contribute to our understanding of the natural world.\nJoin me as I showcase my research experience, including my role as a Research Assistant at the University of Zurich, where I’m working towards publishing key results. I’ve also completed an internship in ecology, delving into the fascinating topic of ecosystem behavior under mutual inhibition.\nIn addition to my research pursuits, I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Biology and Computational Science, and I’m currently pursuing my Master’s degree in Computational Biology and Bioinformatics at ETH. I’ve been recognized for my academic achievements, including the semester prize I received for my internship thesis.\nBeyond my academic pursuits, I’ve gained valuable experience in logistics, military service, and healthcare. With advanced programming skills in Python and R, I bring computational prowess to my research endeavors.\nExplore my website to learn more about my work, skills, and achievements. Get in touch if you’d like to collaborate or discuss exciting opportunities!"

My goal is to gain a deeper understanding of the cultures and histories of these peoples by studying their languages. Currently, I am working on a monograph that explores the linguistic roots of the Elvish languages. Through extensive research and analysis, I hope to shed light on the connections between the different dialects of Elvish and their origins. This project has been particularly challenging, as Elvish is a complex and nuanced language, but I am determined to see it through to completion."
